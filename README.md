![sample image](./assets/wallpaper.png)

Abstractify is a simple web app that provides an image transformation service. This project is part of my ongoing exploration into generative art, with guidance from [Preslav Rachev](https://github.com/preslavrachev)'s book [Generative Art in Go](https://preslav.me/generative-art-in-golang/).
